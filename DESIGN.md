Our project, and iOS app development in general, is centered around a Storyboard, the iOS word for user interface. We then draw connections between the elements of the Storyboard and our Swift code through events triggered by clicks of buttons, entries inside text fields, and selections on the date picker. Each screen that the user can possibly interact with is called a ViewController, each with their own labels and labels. On each ViewController, we have a button we can press to get to other ViewControllers, so that at all times it is possible to get back to the home page. 
On the MainViewController, we have displayed the current time, which is available as a feature of iOS development. We then have a function called “tick” to update the time every second, so that we know precisely what time it is every second, just like a clock. We also have two text fields. In the first one, the user must enter an alarm code if they themselves are creating an alarm. In the second text field, the user enters someone else's code to join their alarm. This data is available because we set up a real-time database in Firebase, a cloud-based database which stores the alarm code as the unique identifier, the time when the alarm should go off, and additionally the time when the alarm was created. Creating an alarm creates a new entry in the database, while joining an alarm queries the database to find the alarm time for a certain alarm code that the user entered. 
We used Firebase as opposed to SQL because there was more documentation related to Firebase and Swift. Furthermore, Firebase allowed us access to a “Realtime Database,” something that we would need for our alarm code creation and joining function. Finally, we thought that Firebase’s horizontal scaling nature would be more advantageous than SQL’s vertical scaling nature. 
Pressing “set alarm” or “join alarm” with a proper code in their corresponding text field sends the user to the AlarmViewController, where the user waits for the alarm to go off. Note that there is a button on the AlarmViewController to cancel the alarm and send us back to the MainViewController. In order to have the correct wake up time on the ViewController, we needed to use a segue to pass information from one ViewController to another. In the segue, we passed on the value selected in the date picker, a time to wake up in the form of “HOUR:MINUTE” and then AM or PM. We pass this on as a variable in the next ViewController so that we can display it in a text field. Then we can use a simple string comparison to send the user to the next ViewController, which displays the message “WAKEY WAKEY '' and starts playing the alarm sound. Our program knows to constantly check for the time because we again called upon the function “tick”, so that the alarm checks if it is time to go off every second. The WakeUpViewController simply displays the message and plays a sound until the button “I’m awake” is pressed. In this case, the alarm sound stops and the user is passed to the next ViewController. 
The final ViewController is a soundboard, which listens for real time updates between users and a server. For this, we used the socket.io library to achieve this because it allows for real time data communication between clients and servers. We imported socket.io into our Swift code to serve as a bidirectional events channel, so that users can communicate in real time. We hosted the server on node.js, which receives the messages “trumpet”, “siren”, “bruh” or “fart” depending on which button was pressed. It then sends the same message back to all the users connected to the server who are currently on the WakeUpViewController, playing the sound on devices that have a socket initialized. On the soundboard, there is a button which can return back to the homepage and stop the device from receiving signals and playing any more sounds.   
In creating this project, we had to learn many new coding languages and skills. Swift was not an easy language to learn because there is a lack of documentation on the language online. Kamryn Ohly was a big help in terms of helping us find the right resources. Then, after figuring out the basic alarm clock and how segways worked, we had to learn how to download and install Cocoapods in order to implement Firebase with our Swift code. After figuring out the Firebase, we then had to figure out how to upload information to the database and query information. Finally, we also had to learn how to use socket.io and create a server in javascript. We put a lot of effort into this project, so we hope you guys enjoy using it as much as we did making it! 

Limitations:
The alarm could run into issues if the user is using military time, in which case the program does not recognize 9:00 pm as equal to 21:00 for example. Since we use string comparison to set off the alarm.
Additionally, we ran into some difficulties in running our server. We had trouble getting our phones to successfully send signals to the node.js server. We only got the program to run in an experimental setting, when all devices were connected to the same mobile hotspot because the server was hosted locally, either on the computer or on the same network. In this case, all the IP addresses were the same, and they could communicate with the server from the same network. We would like to host this server in the future. 

Our grader can review our submitted code and test it for themselves as outlined in the documentation, but we have also created a video demonstrating the app’s backend design and code, including the Firebase database, so we’re hoping this will suffice.
